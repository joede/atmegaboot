Project:    ATmegaBOOT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an adaption of the bootloader code from http://chip45.com/. I've
changed the code to make it easier to configure and to match my requirements.

This code is a first try and I don't know if it is the last one. ;-)

To add support for a new product, copy the product_TEMPLATE.mak to a new file
and replace "TEMPLATE" with a unique shortcut for the products name. Change
the file to fit your need. If necessary, copy config_TEMPLATE.h and
isp_TEMPLATE.mak and replace "TEMPLATE" with the same shortcut.

Attention: be very carefull while editing the fuses in product_TEMPLATE.mak!
It is possible to damage your MCU!

To build the bootloader, call "make PRODUCT=TEMPLATE" and replace "TEMPLATE"
with the shortcut again. As a result, you will get three binaries (bin,
Intel-Hex and Motorola-SRecord).

Note: to configure the ISP settings, just edit config_isp.mak!

So the first steps for a product "FOO" could look like this:

   $ cp product_TEMPLATE.mak projects/product_FOO.mak
   $ editor product_FOO.mak
   $ cp isp_TEMPLATE.mak projects/isp_FOO.mak
   $ editor isp_FOO.mak
   $ cp config_TEMPLATE.h projects/config_FOO.h
   $ editor config_FOO.h
   $ make PRODUCT=FOO
   $ ls -1 ATmegaBOOT_FOO*
   $ ATmegaBOOT_FOO_V1_0.bin
   $ ATmegaBOOT_FOO_V1_0.hex
   $ ATmegaBOOT_FOO_V1_0.srec


Have fun.
